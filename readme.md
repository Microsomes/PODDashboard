##Breif explanation
Print on demand factories are exploding everywhere across the world, with this 
excessive demand comes lots of inefficiency. I spend the last year or so working 
at some of this print on demand companies to see how the production went,
i noticed a lot of timewasting issues revolving around keeping orders and items organised,and the 
headache of tracking down an order on the factory floor

In short i plan on designing and creating a POS-Factory software to 
keep track of orders which can be added via 3 import methods XML,JSON REST and using excel. The system will be designed to be fitted in even
the most outdated and convoluted factory setups. 

We will then create multiple scanning stations to give each item or order a unique history in the pipeline,
the admin can create as many stations as they want, as required by the factories unique requirements. Each scanning
station will write a note in history for that item or order being scanned, so the personnel on the ground or support team can track each item.
